description: This post contains my point of view on what is important to make a meeting (or pretty much every discussion) pleasant and efficient.

One of the problems I observe in communication (and I have this problem myself) is that we _imply_ things.
When we start a conversation we rarely start from providing the context and rush straight into what we want to
say or ask. We imply that everyone is in the context of what we are going to talk about. Especially if
the topic of the discussion is declared. This is a selfish notion. And when we expect that people
are ready to jump into our train of thought, we are almost always wrong.

The reason is simple - obvious things are not obvious. Or, at least, they are not obvious to everyone.

The good thing is that it doesn't require much effort to fix it. I came up with these ideas when I was teaching.

ðŸ‘‡ [**TL;DR**](#tldr)

## Ingredients of a better discussion

These are not the things you have to do. They are the things _I do in specific scenarios_.

### Before the talk

#### Plan the discussion in advance

It's a good idea to have an agenda for the meeting. It's even better idea to share it with everyone
in advance. Probably, right in the invitation. To come up with one, I clearly state for myself what the
expected outcomes of the discussion are.

> If things don't go according to the plan, it was an insufficient plan.

We often discuss tricky things, covered in fogs of uncertainty and misunderstanding. To be
prepared for that, I try to predict observable branches of the conversation flow. If things
are overwhelming, I draw a directed graph where _edges_ represent intermediate answers and _nodes_
represent further questions. It helps me understand what I could ask next. Occasionally, the stars collide
and I manage to make a good forecast. The idea here is to foresee the paths from the starting point to
one of the end points. A benefit that comes for free is that in some cases you can see what end point
you are most probably going to, but there might be unexpected moves.

That's the foundation for creating an agenda, it just needs to be made human-readable and added to the
invitation.

#### Keep the background in mind

This one is mostly relevant when preparing for a talk with more than one person. Yet the underlying logic
applies even for a small talk with a colleague in the hall (if you are the kind of person who needs
to prepare for that).

Before I initiate a talk, I spend some time analyzing "personas" that I am going to communicate with.
Thus, I find out who is needed (if the list of participants is not yet clear) and what I need to tell
them to make sure everyone is on the same page. I tend to abstract away from reality to avoid possible
biases that, believe it or not, exist in everyone. This approach also helps me get prepared to talking
to people for the first time. When I look at "personas" in my head, I typically focus on wider context
and then narrow down to specific features. Throughout the process, I only pick things that may be
relevant in terms of upcoming discussion.

The goal of this exercise is to find out how to group participants by **X** and then prepare a plan
that would get to the group rather than individuals. Thus you can speed up the preparations dramatically.

If I need to make a call right now, this step is the only thing I do.

#### Reserve some time for Q & A

If there are no questions during the talk AND at the end of the talk, it generally means that either you
are superior, or you are not. Better hope for the best, but I have the metrics - if the goal of the
discussion was reached - job's done.

But most of the meetings are full of clarifications, digressions and side talks. It's natural and there's
nothing bad about it. So I just make some room for those things when I pick the time slot.

#### Make sure everyone who should participate CAN participate

I taught myself to check the schedule of those I am going to invite. Don't pull the anxiety trigger by
creating events atop existing events. In the best scenario, the person will evaluate what is more important and
pick the event which they find more relevant. My subjective point is: it is not possible _before_ the talk. And
chances are, you will get the maybe/tentative status because you came the second. Moreover, I see others
mastering the creation of catchy meetings names so I'm just not good enough to beat them. So, for me an easier
way is to find a time slot that suits everyone. Another piece of advice - don't send invites to people who are
on a leave. If they are from a different country, respect national holidays.

Although it might seem OK to create event hamburgers for those marked as "optional", it should still be
avoided. If you just want the person to be informed about the event - better use other means. But, from my
experience, not the events matter - their outcomes do. So, I typically just [send them a follow-up](#send-a-follow-up).

### During the talk

#### Make a brief introduction and provide the context

Now that everyone understands, what they are destined to, it's time to help people dive in. For me, the rule
of the thumb is to **spend at least 10% of the meeting time to provide the context**. If there are
questions or requests for clarification, I let some reasonable time to process them.

The tricky part here is keeping the balance between going too deep and providing lacking information.
I tend to go "shallow mode" and ask for the need of extension on the things that are directly
related to what is going to be discussed during the topic.

#### Take notes

If I happen to be the one who talks the most, I ask someone to make notes and then hand them to me. Don't
pass the obligation to send follow-ups to others. Respect their time. Moreover, there might be people
outside the invited group who are also interested in the outcomes of the discussion.

### After the talk

#### Complete the conversation

NEVER run out of time. If I feel that the discussion is not over and we only have 15 minutes left, I let everyone
know that you are going to set up another call. We settle down all the questions that can be quickly closed
and finish the discussion.

> NEVER run out of time.

Do your best to reach the expected result in less time than is reserved. You would do everyone a great favour,
if you created a free spot in their schedules so that they could go and make a coffee and prepare for what
they have to do next. On the other hand, don't prefer redundant time just to get the reputation of a nice
person to have meetings with - people will get used to it and soon you'll get in a situation when even that amount
of time is not enough. Guess who will lose the reputation at once? Besides, you block others from
using the time for what is really important.

#### Send a follow-up

After the meeting, send a follow up. As I've said [earlier](#make-notes), do it yourself. I include everyone who
was on the call and share an edited version to other stakeholders who need to be informed. A good practice is
to have a [RACI matrix](https://youtu.be/TMT_WPFh6RU) [^1] to be clear with who needs to know what.

#### Document outcomes

I occasionally happen to come to the result which is different from "we need to check with X", "nobody knows",
etc. In this case, it makes sense to document it so that the discussion does not pop up again. Sometimes,
the decisions made are controversial and may lead to questions about the reasons. To proactively mitigate them,
I add a decision log and describe the key points why the decision was made. If someone still has alternative
suggestions, it's a good idea to find time to listen to them - maybe they have a completely different, and by far
less controversial, ideas about the topic. Even if it is not possible to do it the better way, save the thoughts
for the future generations. I have never seen projects that were finished. Someday someone will do something
with where you left off. Leave them a message, saying that there's a track to wander.

## TL;DR

```markdown
- **_NOTHING_** is obvious.
- Have a plan.
- Always start a conversation with providing the context. Emphasize what matters most.
- Don't allow digressions.
- Allow asking for clarification on the go. Answer questions.
- Make notes. Summarize. Send follow-ups.
- Document agreements to reduce the amount of repetitive discussions of the same things. If the topic is controversial, add the decision log.
```

  **RACI** matrix, also known as **REM** (Responsibility Assignment Matrix) or **LRC** (Linear Responsibility Chart)
  is a way to describe the participation by various roles in doing things. There are four roles:

  |    Role     | Participation                             |
  | :---------: | ----------------------------------------- |
  | Responsible | those who do the work                     |
  | Accountable | those who are answerable for the delivery |
  |  Consulted  | people whose opinion is sought            |
  |  Informed   | kept up-to-date on progress               |
